Introduction

If you went through the Ruby course you will have already installed Ruby. But if you haven’t done that, then now is the time to install it as you will need Ruby installed before we tackle installing Rails.

With Ruby installed, you’re all set to install Rails and create our first Rails app to ensure everything went smoothly.
